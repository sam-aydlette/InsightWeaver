# CLAUDE.md

## Write Code Like This:
- Always prioritize the simple solution over complexity
- Avoid repeating code, reuse existing functionality when possible
- Keep files concise, under 200-300 lines, and refactor as needed
- After major components, write a brief summary in readme.md
- Do not use emojis

## Work This Way:
- Modify only the code I specify, leave everything else untouched
- Break large tasks into stages, pause after each for my approval
- Before large changes, write a plan and await my confirmation
- DO NOT LIE

## Talk To Me Like This:
- After each component, summarize what is done
- Classify changes as small, medium or large
- If my request is unclear, ask me before proceeding
