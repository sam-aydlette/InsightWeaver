## Implementation Considerations

### Data Access Methods

**APIs (Preferred)**
- RESTful APIs with JSON responses
- GraphQL endpoints
- WebSocket connections for real-time data
- RSS/Atom feeds for regular updates

**Web Scraping (When Necessary)**
- Structured HTML parsing
- PDF document extraction
- Selenium for JavaScript-rendered content
- Respectful rate limiting and caching

**File Downloads**
- CSV/Excel data dumps
- Bulk data downloads (FTP/SFTP)
- Torrent-based distribution (some government data)
- Scheduled batch processing

### Priority Criteria

**High Priority Sources Should Be:**
1. **Actionable** - Information that drives immediate decisions
2. **Authoritative** - Official or highly reliable sources
3. **Time-sensitive** - Information that loses value quickly
4. **Locally relevant** - Direct impact on user's geographic area
5. **Machine-readable** - Easy to parse and integrate

### Technical Challenges

**Data Quality Issues**
- Inconsistent formatting across sources
- Missing or incomplete data
- Duplicate information from multiple sources
- Conflicting information requiring verification

**Integration Complexity**
- Authentication requirements (API keys, OAuth)
- Rate limiting and quota management
- Data normalization and standardization
- Entity resolution across sources

**Legal & Ethical Considerations**
- Terms of service compliance
- Personal information privacy (GDPR, CCPA)
- Copyright and fair use
- Responsible disclosure for sensitive information

### Scalability Approach

**Phased Implementation**
1. **Phase 1**: High-value, easy-to-integrate sources
2. **Phase 2**: Sources requiring moderate development effort
3. **Phase 3**: Complex sources with high integration cost
4. **Phase 4**: Experimental and emerging data sources

**Geographic Expansion**
- Start with Northern Virginia sources
- Expand to other Virginia localities
- Add neighboring states (MD, DC)
- Eventually support any US locality

**Source Evaluation Metrics**
- Data freshness and update frequency
- API reliability and uptime
- Information accuracy and corrections rate
- User engagement with source content
- Cost per data point (for paid sources)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Source Prioritization**: Rank sources by value vs. effort matrix
2. **API Inventory**: Document available APIs and access requirements
3. **Legal Review**: Ensure compliance with terms of service
4. **Prototype Integration**: Test top priority sources
5. **User Feedback**: Validate source value with target users
6. **Monitoring Setup**: Establish source health monitoring
7. **Documentation**: Create integration guides for each source
